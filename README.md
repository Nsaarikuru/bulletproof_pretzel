# Bulletproof pretzel
-------------------
## README
------
Bulletproof pretzel was an exercise i did while in school, at the time it featured
just the basic layout of the page and static links with no functionality. 

i came back to it to see what kind of new spin i could give it by adding some dynamics, functionality
and content in place of the static links. I also wanted to try a more mvc-approach since everything on the site 
used to be located in just a single file.
